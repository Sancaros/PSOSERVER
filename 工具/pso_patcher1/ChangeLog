Sylverant PSO Patcher ChangeLog
-------------------------------

v1.2 -> v2.0:
----------------------------------------
* Pretty much rewrote the entire patcher program itself. The new version doesn't
  use KOS itself (although it does borrow a few files from it). Most of the rest
  of the changes in this version are related to that.
* Added in Marcus Comstedt's cdfs code with slight modifications.
* Added in Marcus Comstedt's maple code.
* Added in a few utility files from KOS (video.[ch], biosfont.[ch], cdrom.[ch]),
  some with slight modifications.
* Added support for patching the server address in the PSO Network Trial
  Edition.
* Switched from using PNG files in a romdisk to just embedding the background in
  the program itself by way of a header file. The img-enc directory contains the
  code needed to create the image data headers. img-enc takes in a file that
  contains the raw 32-bit RGBX pixels of the image and spits out an RLE'd 16-bit
  version. bin2c (from KOS) turns that binary into a header file for inclusion
  in the program. You can generate the 32-bit RGBX image files by using The Gimp
  and selecting to export to raw image data.
* Adjusted fb_console to the fact that we don't have libc, so no vsnprintf.
* Rewrote the boot stub function and moved it out of the code that is kept
  resident while the game is running.
* In the process of doing all that other stuff, fixed booting all kinds of games
  that would not boot with the patcher before.
* Another thing that got fixed in the process of doing all that is the strange
  bug where you would immediately get a Time Up message if you tried to play
  Battle Mode in PSO (so, no, it wasn't a server-side issue).
* Added in support for patching the background music for the Spaceship and
  Palace stages so that they can be used with sensible background music in non-
  Battle quests. This patch is on by default for all PSOv2 versions, but can be
  turned off by starting the game with A instead of Start.

v1.1 -> v1.2:
----------------------------------------
 * Fix an issue with booting games with multiple data tracks in the high-density
   area of the GD-ROM.
 * Fix booting of games that the main binary is not called 1ST_READ.BIN.
 * Add support for building a patcher for Planet Ring (use "make prpatcher")

v1.0 -> v1.1 (Released August 31, 2011):
----------------------------------------
 * Fix an issue where the the game would only display a black screen when using
   a VGA box.
 * Fix various in-game glitchy/broken behavior when using the patcher.
